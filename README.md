# ButtonBin - LDB Container for World of Warcraft

ButtonBin is a display addon for LibDataBroker objects. The initial design goal was to make a very compact display for LDB launchers, ignoring the labels. It has since evolved to become more of a full featured display addon, allowing both the compact button-only view as well as displaying labels with icons.
